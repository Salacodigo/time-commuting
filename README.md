# time-commuting

Developed in Javascript Vanilla, CSS - Sass

Time calculator to determine how much time you lose due to traffic in your city.

With this tool we can highlight one of the main advantajes of remote workplaces today.

Can we consider as a waste time the habit of hiring people and assume that the only place where digital workers are productive is in the office.

This calculator reflects the misconception that 8h a day sitting in the office corresponds to a productive worker.
